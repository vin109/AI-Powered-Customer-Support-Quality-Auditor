# AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Quality-Auditor
Project Statement:
This project aims to build a GenAI-powered quality auditing platform that reviews customer
support chats and calls, assigns quality scores, detects compliance violations, and suggests
improvements in real time. By combining NLP, RAG pipelines, and speech-to-text
transcription, the platform leverages LLMs to evaluate tone, empathy, compliance with scripts,
and resolution effectiveness. Designed for enterprises, BPOs, and SaaS companies, the
solution enhances customer experience, ensures compliance, and reduces manual QA
workload.
